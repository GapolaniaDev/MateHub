# MateHub ü§ù

*Building bridges across cultures through shared experiences*

## The Problem & Our Solution

Australia's multicultural communities often struggle to connect meaningfully across cultural boundaries. Traditional networking events lack incentives for genuine intercultural exchange, and people tend to stay within their comfort zones.

**MateHub** (formerly Cohesion Pass) is an iOS app that gamifies cultural diversity at community events. By offering tangible discounts and rewards based on a user's Multicultural Diversity Index (MDI), we incentivize authentic cross-cultural connections and break down social barriers.

### üìä Dataset Attributions

- **Core Dataset
	- Scanlon Institute ‚Äì Mapping Social Cohesion 2024

- 
## üì± Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- iOS 15.0+ / Xcode 13+
- CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager
- Device with location services capability

### Run Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GapolaniaDev/MateHub.git
   cd MateHub
   ```

2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open LatunGovHack.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Configure permissions in `Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>MateHub needs location access to show nearby cultural events</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Voice surveys help improve cultural event experiences</string>
   <key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Speech recognition enables hands-free survey responses</string>
   ```

4. Build and run on simulator or device
   - **Note**: Voice features require physical device; simulator shows placeholder UI

### Database Seeding
The app includes a pre-populated database with:
- 50+ diverse community events across major Australian cities
- 100+ achievement badges with cultural themes
- Sample user profiles with varied cultural backgrounds
- Historical event data for testing time tracking features

## Multicultural Diversity Index (MDI)

The MDI is MateHub's core algorithm that quantifies a user's cross-cultural engagement:

### Calculation Formula
```swift
MDI = (Cultural_Backgrounds √ó 0.3) + 
      (Cross_Cultural_Events √ó 0.4) + 
      (Community_Bridges_Built √ó 0.3)
```

### Discount Scale
- **MDI 0.0-2.0**: 15% discount on events
- **MDI 2.1-3.5**: 20% discount on events  
- **MDI 3.6-5.0**: 25% discount on events

### Bridge Building Metrics
- **Community Bridge**: Attend events with 3+ different cultural groups
- **Language Bridge**: Participate in multilingual events
- **Generational Bridge**: Mixed-age group participation
- **Faith Bridge**: Interfaith community events
- **Geographic Bridge**: Events across different suburbs/regions

### Cultural Background Classifications
Based on Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG) 2019:
- 40+ cultural background categories
- Regional groupings for Oceania, Asia, Europe, Americas, Africa, Middle East
- Indigenous Australian cultural recognition protocols

## üîí Privacy & Ethics

### Data Collection
- **Location**: Only when actively using map features
- **Voice**: Processed locally, never stored on servers
- **Cultural Identity**: User-declared, never assumed or auto-detected
- **Participation**: Always opt-in for diversity tracking

### Ethical AI Considerations
- No algorithmic bias in cultural categorization
- User agency in cultural identity representation
- Transparent MDI scoring methodology
- Right to data deletion and score reset

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Collaborated with multicultural community organizations
- Regular bias auditing of event recommendations
- Indigenous cultural protocols respected in all features
- No stereotyping or cultural assumptions in UI/UX
