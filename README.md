# MateHub ü§ù

*Building bridges across cultures through shared experiences*

## The Problem & Our Solution

Australia's multicultural communities often struggle to connect meaningfully across cultural boundaries. Traditional networking events lack incentives for genuine intercultural exchange, and people tend to stay within their comfort zones.

**MateHub** (formerly Cohesion Pass) is an iOS app that gamifies cultural diversity at community events. By offering tangible discounts and rewards based on a user's Multicultural Diversity Index (MDI), we incentivize authentic cross-cultural connections and break down social barriers.

## üéØ Key Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Event Map
- Full-screen map displaying community events with custom pins
- **MINGLE Pricing**: Original prices crossed out, discounted prices prominently displayed
- Random discount percentages (15%, 20%, 25%) based on user's diversity engagement
- Real-time event discovery with location-based filtering

### üë§ Comprehensive Profile System  
- **100+ Achievement Badges**: From "Social Connection Bridge" to specialized cultural engagement trophies
- Personal diversity statistics and MDI scoring
- Event attendance tracking with hours logged
- Profile customization with personal photos

### üé§ Post-Event Voice Surveys
- Simulated voice-to-text transcription with typewriter animation effect

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI with iOS 15+ deployment target
- **Database**: SQLite with custom schema for events, users, and achievements
- **Location**: MapKit integration with custom pin annotations
- **Speech**: AVFoundation with Speech Recognition (simulator fallbacks)
- **Images**: AsyncImage with bundle resource loading
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with ObservableObject ViewModels

### Key Components
- `EnhancedMapView`: Full-screen map with custom pricing pins
- `VoiceAIRegistrationView`: Speech-to-text survey interface  
- `ProfileView`: Badge gallery and user statistics
- `TimeTrackingView`: Activity dashboard with charts
- `EventListView`: Curated event discovery

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core user profiles with diversity tracking
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    cultural_backgrounds TEXT, -- JSON array
    mdi_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    total_hours REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    events_attended INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Community events with pricing and diversity incentives
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    latitude REAL NOT NULL,
    longitude REAL NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    date_time TIMESTAMP,
    diversity_bonus_eligible BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
);

-- Achievement system for cultural bridge-building
CREATE TABLE badges (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    icon_name TEXT,
    unlock_criteria TEXT, -- JSON object
    rarity TEXT CHECK(rarity IN ('common', 'rare', 'epic', 'legendary'))
);

-- User achievement unlocks
CREATE TABLE user_badges (
    user_id INTEGER,
    badge_id INTEGER,
    unlocked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, badge_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (badge_id) REFERENCES badges(id)
);
```

## üì± Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- iOS 15.0+ / Xcode 13+
- CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager
- Device with location services capability

### Run Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GapolaniaDev/MateHub.git
   cd MateHub
   ```

2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open LatunGovHack.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Configure permissions in `Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>MateHub needs location access to show nearby cultural events</string>
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Voice surveys help improve cultural event experiences</string>
   <key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Speech recognition enables hands-free survey responses</string>
   ```

4. Build and run on simulator or device
   - **Note**: Voice features require physical device; simulator shows placeholder UI

### Database Seeding
The app includes a pre-populated database with:
- 50+ diverse community events across major Australian cities
- 100+ achievement badges with cultural themes
- Sample user profiles with varied cultural backgrounds
- Historical event data for testing time tracking features

## üåà Multicultural Diversity Index (MDI)

The MDI is MateHub's core algorithm that quantifies a user's cross-cultural engagement:

### Calculation Formula
```swift
MDI = (Cultural_Backgrounds √ó 0.3) + 
      (Cross_Cultural_Events √ó 0.4) + 
      (Community_Bridges_Built √ó 0.3)
```

### Discount Scale
- **MDI 0.0-2.0**: 15% discount on events
- **MDI 2.1-3.5**: 20% discount on events  
- **MDI 3.6-5.0**: 25% discount on events

### Bridge Building Metrics
- **Community Bridge**: Attend events with 3+ different cultural groups
- **Language Bridge**: Participate in multilingual events
- **Generational Bridge**: Mixed-age group participation
- **Faith Bridge**: Interfaith community events
- **Geographic Bridge**: Events across different suburbs/regions
